# AD9833 Function Generator

The basic functionality is in place, the AD9833
library works well. Currently working on phase
shift detection circuitry so I can also work
in bode plotting. In this post covid world, I
seem to be just waiting on parts half the time,
if I can even find them in stock.  

Required parts-  
* Blue pill or any other STM32F103C8T6 board
* AD9833 breakout board
* (Bode plot circuitry still not decided.
Currently debating between a XOR gate based
phase detector and just shifting the entire
thing to an FPGA and ADC)
